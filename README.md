### Hello there, visitor!

My name is Felipe Martin, and I'm a Software Engineer working remotely at [**@mattermost**](https://github.com/mattermost).

- Iâ€™m currently working as a **Senior Software Engineer** using **Golang** as my primary language.
- I've worked in the past with **Python**, **Docker**, **Podman**, **PostgreSQL**, **SQLite**, **Django**, **Jenkins**... check out my Github repositories!
  - I also happen to have my own git server for small repos, proof of concepts, courses and other stuff [here](https://code.fmartingr.dev) if you're curious.
- I'm interested in learning **Golang**, **Rust** or any other technology I've worked with in the past.
